# HackBio Biocoding Internship - Stage Zero

#Project Overview

This repository contains my solution for organizing team information using an R data frame. The task required us to store the following data using any data structure of our choice:

- Names
- Slack Usernames
- Email Addresses
- Hobbies
- Countries
- Disciplines
- Preferred Programming Languages

In this solution, I used vectors to store each type of information and then combined them into a data frame called `team_info`.

# Code Explanation

1. Creating Vectors:
   - I created separate vectors for each category:
     - `name`: Contains the names of team members.
     - `slack_name`: Contains the corresponding Slack usernames.
     - `country`: Contains the countries of origin.
     - `email`: Contains the email addresses.
     - `hobby`: Contains the hobbies of each team member.
     - `discipline`: Contains the academic disciplines.
     - `preferred_lang`: Contains the preferred programming languages.

2. Building the Data Frame:
   - The individual vectors are combined using the `data.frame()` function to form the `team_info` data frame.
   - This organizes the information in a tabular format, making it easy to view and manipulate.

3. Displaying the Data Frame:
   - The final step prints the `team_info` data frame to display the organized information.
